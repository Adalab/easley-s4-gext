## What's GEXT?

GEXT is a very useful platform that will allow you to generate presentations with superpowers!
It helps companies and users to generate final and sharable documents from templates.

### How to use GEXT?

1. Login with your Gmail account.
2. Select your template from your Drive account or choose one from your computer.
3. Fill the inputs required and/or select an image from your computer.
4. Congratulations! Your presentation is ready! Now, you can view or download it directly to your computer.

### How do I create a template in order to use it with GEXT?

The keywords should be named according to the following nomenclature:
- Text: If you want to replace text use two moustaches like this: {{example}}
- Image: If you want to change an image use three moustaches like this: {{{logo}}}

### How it works?

Once you have selected a template, this wonderful application will search all given keywords (following the previous said nomenclature) and autogenerate a useful form where you can change those keywords and images to whatever you need. Finally, you will be redirected to a final page where you can view your document in Drive or download it directly to your computer (in pptx or pdf format).

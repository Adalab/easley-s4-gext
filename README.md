## What's GEXT?

GEXT is a very useful platform that will allow you to generate presentations with superpowers!
It helps companies and users to generate final and sharable documents from templates.

### How to use GEXT?

1. Log in to Gext with your Google account and select the template.
2. Select your template from your Drive account or choose one from your computer.
3. You already have in your hands the superpower: the fields of the presentation that you have "gexted" will automatically appear and you will be able to fill them in order to automatically generate a new copy.
4. Congratulations! Your presentation is ready! Now, you can take a look or download it. And remember:
"With great power comes great responsibility".

### How do I create a template in order to use it with GEXT?

To get all the superpowers from Gext presentations, in your template:

1. Write between two curly braces the text fields that you want to change...
2. or between three curly braces the images that you want to insert.

For example: {{name}} {{{image}}}


### How it works?

Once you have selected a template, this wonderful application will search all given keywords (following the previous said nomenclature) and autogenerate a useful form where you can change those keywords and images to whatever you need. Finally, you will be redirected to a final page where you can view your document in Drive or download it directly to your computer (in pptx or pdf format).
